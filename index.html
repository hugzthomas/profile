          <h3>CLIMAX</h3>
          <p>A scientist discovers that planet Earth has been surrounded by UFOs for many decades. Reason why they have never attacked... Hollywood movies have already counter attacked their plans to invade.
          Independance day, Predator, Signs, Mars attacks...
          All these magnificent movies that only served as entertainment, turned out to be the means of our survival.
          With the decline of the film industry, sci-fi movies have not been has great as they used to be, allowing aliens to find a breach in our defense.
          Our only hope, as bad as it seems, a group of geeks that figured out the solution... Write the perfect Hollywood screenplay… </p>
